Anonymous Message Board

**What is this app**

Full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to 2channel, 4chan and other message boards. What is particular about this app is the ability for anonymous users to create freely all sorts of threads about any topic.

**To do**
- Better the front end of the app
- Add a list of live boards on the index.
